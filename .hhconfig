# Motivation
#   Currently when we have around 3310 *.hh files the hh_client starts to fail with the error code of 16.
#   The only time this exception is raised is when we are unable to add an element into HHVM shared hash table.
#   This cause the follow bugs to happen:
#       * Being unable to run make compile-apps
#       * Being unable to run hh_client commands
#       * Causes the hh_server to log errors as we are running unit-tests
# Modifications
#   This updates the maximum elements we can add into HHVM shared cached, by changing it from the default (18) to 20.
#   This add the ability to add another 786,432 elements in the shard cached before we are unable to add more elements
#   into the cache.
# Results
#   This changes the HHVM hash table load factor:
#       Before: Hashtable load factor: 247971 / 262144 (0.95) with 247971 nonempty slots
#        After: Hashtable load factor: 247971 / 1048576 (0.24) with 247971 nonempty slots
#      log generated by: hh_server --check $(pwd)
sharedmem_hash_table_pow = 20
